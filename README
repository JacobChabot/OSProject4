Jacob Chabot Project 4 

This project aimed to create multiple processes and schedule them using different queues. I did not complete this project as best as I would have liked to but I did my best. 

Issues/Bugs:

Occasionally will get a semop error. I believe it would happen on the last process and OSS will have finished and deleted the semaphore before the last process could terminate. Added a 
sleep(2) to delay OSS enough for the last process to finish.

Items not completed due to time and understanding:

*did not utilize clock
*did not utilize message queues
*did not utilze queue's to the extent of the project document requested, at the beginning I thought we just need two queues for the different priorities
*did not utilize process blocking
*did not keep track of output statistic

Notes:

Added printf statements in the child process
